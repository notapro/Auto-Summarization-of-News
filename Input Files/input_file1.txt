Google has been given access to an estimated 1.6 million NHS patient records, it has been revealed.
The data-sharing agreement, revealed by New Scientist, includes full names as well as patient histories.
Google says it will use the data to develop an early warning system for patients at risk of developing acute kidney injuries.
But critics have questioned why it needs the data of all patients to create such a specific app.
Under the data-sharing agreement, Google's artificial intelligence division DeepMind will have access to all of the data of patients from the Royal Free, Barnet and Chase Farm hospitals in London going back over the past five years and continuing until 2017.
The data remains encrypted, meaning that Google employees should not be able to identify anyone, according to the Royal Free Trust.
Sam Smith, a co-ordinator of patient data campaign group MedConfidential, said: "The big question is why they want it. This a very rich data set. If you are someone who went to the A&E department, why is your data in this?"
Google said that it needed general data in order to identify patients who might be at risk of developing acute kidney injuries (AKI). It plans to use the data to develop an app known as Streams that will alert doctors when someone is at risk of developing AKI.
AKI is a contributing factor in up to 20% of emergency hospital admissions, according to the NHS. It estimates that around a quarter of cases are preventable.
It is not clear how exactly Google will use the data to provide this early warning system but the BBC understands that no artificial intelligence will be used.
