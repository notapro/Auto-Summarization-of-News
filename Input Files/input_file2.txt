Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has decisively won the Wisconsin primary,
complicating front-runner Donald Trump's path to the nomination. In the Democratic
race, Bernie Sanders scored a strong victory over Hillary Clinton in the Midwestern
state. Mr. Trump leads the race, but could fall short of the number of delegates needed
to secure the Republican nomination. Mr Trump's rivals hope for a brokered convention
where voting among candidates would start from scratch. Mr. Trump said on Tuesday
he would prevail despite the loss and took aim at his main rival. "Ted Cruz is worse than
a puppet - he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the
nomination," the Trump campaign said in a statement. Party leaders are concerned that
Mr. Trump would be a weak candidate in the general election and could harm other
Republicans lawmakers on the ballot. Polls show that the real estate tycoon is extremely
unpopular among key voting blocs including women, Latinos and young people.
